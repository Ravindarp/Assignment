    "Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty to the OLS objective function to control the magnitude of the coefficients. This helps to prevent overfitting, which can occur when the model is too complex and learns the noise in the data instead of the underlying relationships.\n",

    "Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a basic linear regression model that minimizes the sum of squared residuals between the predicted and actual values. It does not penalize the coefficients, so it can sometimes lead to overfitting.\n",
