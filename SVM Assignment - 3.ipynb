    "The best regression metric to employ in this situation would be the mean squared error (MSE). MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models.\n",
    "In the context of house price prediction, MSE can be used to measure how accurate the SVM regression model is at predicting the actual house prices. A lower MSE value indicates that the model is more accurate.\n",
    "Other regression metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of the SVM regression model include:\n",
    "Root mean squared error (RMSE): This is the square root of MSE. It is a more interpretable metric than MSE, but it is also more sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "Mean absolute error (MAE): This is the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers than RMSE.\n",
    "R-squared: This is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the actual values that is explained by the model. A higher R-squared value indicates that the model is more accurate.\n",
    "The choice of which regression metric to use depends on the specific situation. In general, MSE is a good choice for most situations. However, if the data contains outliers, then MAE may be a better choice. And if you are interested in the overall fit of the model, then R-squared may be a better choice."

    "The most appropriate regression metric to use with an SVM model in a scenario with a significant number of outliers is the mean absolute error (MAE). MAE is less sensitive to outliers than other regression metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE).\n",
    "MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. This means that outliers, which are data points that are far away from the rest of the data, can have a big impact on the MSE value. MAE, on the other hand, measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. This means that outliers have less of an impact on the MAE value.\n",
    "In addition, MAE is easier to interpret than MSE. MSE is measured in squared units, which can be difficult to understand. MAE is measured in the same units as the target variable, which makes it easier to understand.\n",

    "In your case, the target variable is house price, which is measured in dollars. Therefore, RMSE is a more interpretable metric than MSE. It is easier to understand that an RMSE value of 10,000 means that the predicted house prices are on average 10,000 dollars away from the actual house prices.\n",

    "In your case, you have calculated both MSE and RMSE and found that both values are very close. This means that the model is not very sensitive to outliers. Therefore, you can choose to use either metric. However, RMSE is the more interpretable metric, so it is the better choice."
