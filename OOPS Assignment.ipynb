    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of the objects that are created from it. An object is an instance of a class. It has the properties and behaviors defined by its class.\n",
    "For example, a class called Dog could define the properties name, breed, and age. It could also define the behaviors bark(), wagTail(), and eat(). An object created from the Dog class would have all of these properties and behaviors.\n",
    "Here is another example. A class called Car could define the properties make, model, and year. It could also define the behaviors drive(), stop(), and turn(). An object created from the Car class would have all of these properties and behaviors.\n",
    "Classes and objects are the two main building blocks of object-oriented programming. They allow programmers to create reusable code that can be easily modified and extended"

    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the unnecessary details of an object and only showing the essential details. This makes the code more readable and maintainable. For example, a car object might have an engine, wheels, and doors, but the user of the car object does not need to know how the engine works or how the doors open.\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called an object. This makes the code more secure and prevents unauthorized access to data. For example, the car object might have a method called drive(). This method is encapsulated within the car object, so only the car object can call it.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability of a new object (child object) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing object (parent object). This makes the code more reusable and efficient. For example, a sports car object might inherit from a car object. This means that the sports car object will have all the properties and methods of a car object, plus any additional properties and methods that are specific to sports cars.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. For example, an animal object might be an abstract class. This means that it cannot be instantiated directly. However, it can be used to create concrete classes such as a dog object and a cat object. These concrete classes can have different implementations of the same methods, which is polymorphism."
