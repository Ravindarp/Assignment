    "Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster, and then iteratively merges the closest clusters until a stopping criterion is reached. The result of hierarchical clustering is a tree-like structure, called a dendrogram, which illustrates the hierarchical relationships among the clusters.\n",
    "Here are some of the key features of hierarchical clustering:\n",
    "It is a divisive or agglomerative algorithm. In divisive hierarchical clustering, all the data points are initially grouped into a single cluster, and then the algorithm recursively splits the clusters into smaller and smaller clusters until each cluster contains a single data point. In agglomerative hierarchical clustering, each data point is initially considered to be a separate cluster, and then the algorithm recursively merges the closest clusters until there is only a single cluster.\n",
    "It is a top-down or bottom-up algorithm. In top-down hierarchical clustering, the algorithm starts with a single cluster and then recursively splits the clusters into smaller and smaller clusters. In bottom-up hierarchical clustering, the algorithm starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then recursively merges the closest clusters until there is only a single cluster.\n",
    "It can be used to cluster data points of any type.\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering is different from other clustering techniques in several ways:\n",
    "It creates a hierarchy of clusters, rather than a single set of clusters. This can be useful for visualizing the relationships between the clusters.\n",
    "It is a non-parametric algorithm, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data. This makes it a versatile algorithm that can be used on a variety of data sets."

    "The distance between two clusters in hierarchical clustering is determined by the distance between the points in the two clusters. The most common distance metrics used in hierarchical clustering are:\n",

    "d(x, y) = |x1 - y1| + |x2 - y2| + ... + |xn - yn|\n",

    "where a is the average distance between the data point and the data points in its own cluster, and b is the average distance between the data point and the data points in the nearest cluster.\n",
    "A higher silhouette coefficient indicates that the data point is more tightly clustered with its own cluster than with other clusters. The optimal number of clusters is the one that maximizes the average silhouette coefficient.\n",

The reference distribution is a distribution of WSS values that is assumed to be generated by chance. The gap statistic is calculated as follows:\n",
