    "Hierarchical clustering: This algorithm starts by treating each data point as its own cluster. Then, it iteratively merges the closest clusters until there is only one cluster left. Hierarchical clustering can be either agglomerative, where the clusters are merged from the bottom up, or divisive, where the clusters are split from the top down.\n",
    "K-means clustering: This algorithm assumes that there are k clusters in the data. It starts by randomly assigning each data point to one of the k clusters. Then, it iteratively updates the centroids of the clusters and reassigns the data points to the closest centroids. The algorithm terminates when the centroids no longer change.\n",
    "Expectation-maximization (EM) clustering: This algorithm is a probabilistic clustering algorithm that assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The EM algorithm iteratively updates the parameters of the Gaussian distributions and the cluster assignments until the model converges.\n",
    "Density-based clustering: This algorithm groups together data points that are densely packed together. Some of the most common density-based clustering algorithms include DBSCAN and OPTICS.\n",
