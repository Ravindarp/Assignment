    "Random forest regressor is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning to create a model that can be used to predict a continuous value. It is a meta-estimator that creates a forest of decision trees and averages the predictions of the trees to make a final prediction.\n",
    "The random forest regressor works by first creating a bootstrap sample of the training data. A bootstrap sample is a randomly drawn sample of the data with replacement. This means that some data points may be included in the bootstrap sample multiple times, while other data points may not be included at all.\n",
    "Once the bootstrap sample has been created, a decision tree is created for each data point in the sample. The decision tree is created by recursively splitting the data into smaller and smaller groups until each group contains only data points of the same value. The splitting process is done by selecting the feature and split point that minimizes the impurity of the data.\n",
    "The impurity of a data set is a measure of how mixed the data is. There are different impurity measures that can be used, such as the Gini index and the entropy. The decision tree is created by repeatedly splitting the data until the impurity of the data is minimized.\n",
    "The predictions of the random forest regressor are made by averaging the predictions of the individual decision trees. This helps to reduce the variance of the predictions and makes the model more robust to overfitting."

    "Bagging: Bagging is a technique that is used to reduce the variance of a model.
