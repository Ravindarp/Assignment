    "The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that states that every normal matrix is diagonalizable. A normal matrix is a matrix that commutes with its transpose.The eigen-decomposition approach is a way of decomposing a square matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The spectral theorem states that if a matrix is normal, then its eigen-decomposition is unique.The significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the eigen-decomposition approach is that it guarantees that the eigen-decomposition of a normal matrix is unique. This means that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a normal matrix can be found unambiguously, and the matrix can be diagonalized in a unique way.Here is an example of how the spectral theorem can be used to diagonalize a matrix.Let's say we have a matrix A that is normal. The spectral theorem states that A is diagonalizable, and its eigen-decomposition is unique. This means that we can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, and we can diagonalize A by multiplying it by a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A.The eigenvalues of A will be real numbers, and the eigenvectors of A will be orthogonal vectors. This means that the matrix of eigenvectors will be an orthogonal matrix.The diagonal matrix of the eigen-decomposition will have the eigenvalues of A on its diagonal. This means that the matrix A can be written as a product of two orthogonal matrices, one of which is a diagonal matrix."
