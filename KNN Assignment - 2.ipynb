    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric is that the Euclidean distance takes into account the squared differences between the coordinates of the two points, while the Manhattan distance only takes into account the absolute differences.\n",
    "This difference can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor in two ways:\n",
    "Sensitivity to outliers: The Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than the Manhattan distance. This is because the squared differences can be large even for small differences, which can make the Euclidean distance more likely to be affected by outliers.\n",
    "Appropriateness for non-normally distributed data: The Manhattan distance is more appropriate for data that is not normally distributed than the Euclidean distance. This is because the Euclidean distance assumes that the data is normally distributed, while the Manhattan distance does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data.\n",
    "In general, the Euclidean distance is a good choice for most KNN applications. However, the Manhattan distance may be a better choice if the data is not normally distributed or if the data contains outliers."

    "here are some common hyperparameters in KNN classifiers and regressors, and how they affect the performance of the model:\n",
    "Number of neighbors (k): This is the most important hyperparameter in KNN. It controls the number of neighbors that are used to calculate the distance to a new data point. A larger value of k will make the model more robust to noise, but it will also make the model less sensitive to the specific points in the training set. A smaller value of k will make the model more sensitive to the specific points in the training set, but it will also make the model less robust to noise.\n",
    "Distance metric: This hyperparameter determines how the distance between two data points is calculated. The most common distance metrics are the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance. The Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than the Manhattan distance.\n",
    "Weighting scheme: This hyperparameter determines how the weights of the neighbors are calculated. The most common weighting schemes are uniform weighting and distance weighting. Uniform weighting gives all neighbors equal weight, while distance weighting gives more weight to closer neighbors.\n",
    "Threshold: This hyperparameter determines the threshold that is used to classify a new data point. A new data point is classified as the majority class of its k nearest neighbors if the distance to the nearest neighbor of the majority class is less than the threshold.\n",
    "The best way to tune these hyperparameters is to experiment with different values on your specific dataset. You can use a technique called grid search to systematically explore different values of the hyperparameters. Grid search involves creating a grid of values for each hyperparameter and then training the model on each combination of values. The model with the best performance on the validation set is then chosen as the best model."
